\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]
Climate timeseries are required at higher resolutions than currently available from GCM or even RCMs for meaningful impact studies. This is especially the case in heterogeneous terrain such as mountain regions where surface variability is high over short horizontal distances. Various methods of downscaling can be utilised to achieve this goal. Dynamical doewnscaling requires no additional data beyond boundary forcing yet is costly and generally applied to limited domains. Statistical downscaling is cheap to run yet requires extensive and robust ground data.

Here we propose a hybrid method that use the quasi-physical topography based method TopoSCALE to generate point forcing timeseries for current period then employs quantile mapping to statistically downscale or debias a climate timeseries at this point. We demonstrate this approach by downscaling CORDEX RCM data at both point scale and additionally generalising this to a spatial product using the tool TopoSUB.

This method provides full forcing suite required to run a numerical model and we further demo this for the case of snowcover in switzerland

\subsection{Quantile mapping (QMAP)}

\subsection{Quantile mapping seasonal(QMAP)}
While quantile mapping ensures that quantile biases are corrected in the CDF it does not account for temporally varying bias. It is therefore well suited to TAS where we can be reasonablly sure that winters are cold and summers hot, at least in mid to high latitudes. However with precipitation interannual distribution can be biased while the cdf may look good. We address this with a two step approach called QMAP\_SEASON. We split the date according to some temporal subset, in this case "summer" (April-September) and "winter" (October - March) and run QMAP on each subset so computing to sets of QMAP parameters. These are applied throughout the historcal and climate timeseries at the approprite months

\subsection{Generalising to subdaily variables}

\subsection{Spatialisation}
\subsection{Evaluation metrics}

Statistical transformations, as any statistical technique,
quietly assume that the modelled relation holds if confronted
with new data. In the context of climate impact assessment
this assumption is critical as it has to be expected that climate variables exceed the observed range in future periods.
Further, highly adaptable methods, such as the nonparametric techniques used in this study, are prone to over fitting the
data. Both issues require that model error is quantified using
data that have not been used for calibration. A standard technique for this task is cross-validation (CV) (e.g. Hastie et al.,
2001) which has been previously applied for evaluating statistical downscaling techniques (e.g. Themeßl et al., 2011,
2012). Here a 10-fold CV was employed to produce unbiased estimates of MAE and MAE0.1, MAE0.2, ..., MAE1.0.
First the data are split into 10 subsamples of continuous time
intervals. The model is then calibrated using the data with
one of the subsamples being removed. MAE and MAE0.1,
MAE0.2, ..., MAE1.0 are then estimated using the subsample
that was not used for calibration. This procedure is repeated
for each subsample and results in 10 estimates of model error. The mean of these 10 error estimates, the so called mean
cross-validation error, is reported. In the remainder of this article MAE and MAE0.1, MAE0.2, ..., MAE1.0 always refers
to the mean cross-validation error to ease formulation.

Evaluation of RQM
Practical considerations
For the evaluation of the transfer functions of both BCMs (i.e., QDM and RQM), we split the data into two periods; one for calibration and the other for validation, which is an approach widely applied in bias correction (Michelangeli et al. 2009; Piani et al. 2010a, b; Hempel et al. 2013; Vrac and Friederichs 2015). Here, the calibration period (CP) covers the years from 1960 to 1982, while the validation period (VP) includes the years from 1983 to 2005. Hence, each period covers 23 years of observed and modeled data. Note that the performed splitting implicitly assumes that all distributional changes in both observed and modeled data are the same during both periods, which should in general be critically assessed since trends may be nonlinear or just cannot be disentangled from low frequency variability. Nonetheless, making this assumption is crucial to be able to perform a detailed evaluation of the two BCMs’ respective performance characteristics.

The CP is used to calibrate both, QDM
