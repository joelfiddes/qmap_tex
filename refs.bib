  abstract  = "Abstract. Snow distribution in complex alpine terrain and its
               evolution in the future climate is important in a variety of
               applications including hydropower, avalanche forecasting and
               freshwater resources. However, it is still challenging to
               quantitatively forecast precipitation, especially over complex
               terrain where the interaction between local wind and
               precipitation fields strongly affects snow distribution at the
               mountain ridge scale. Therefore, it is essential to retrieve
               high-resolution information about precipitation processes over
               complex terrain. Here, we present very-high-resolution Weather
               Research and Forecasting model (WRF) simulations (COSMO--WRF),
               which are initialized by 2.2 km resolution Consortium for
               Small-scale Modeling (COSMO) analysis. To assess the ability of
               COSMO--WRF to represent spatial snow precipitation patterns,
               they are validated against operational weather radar
               measurements. Estimated COSMO--WRF precipitation is generally
               higher than estimated radar precipitation, most likely due to an
               overestimation of orographic precipitation enhancement in the
               model. The high precipitation amounts also lead to a higher
               spatial variability in the model compared to radar estimates.
               Overall, an autocorrelation and scale analysis of radar and
               COSMO--WRF precipitation patterns at a horizontal grid spacing
               of 450 m show that COSMO--WRF captures the spatial variability
               normalized by the domain-wide variability in precipitation
               patterns down to the scale of a few kilometers. However,
               simulated precipitation patterns systematically show a lower
               variability on the smallest scales of a few hundred meters
               compared to radar estimates. A comparison of spatial variability
               for different model resolutions gives evidence for an improved
               representation of local precipitation processes at a horizontal
               resolution of 50 m compared to 450 m. Additionally, differences
               of precipitation between 2830 m above sea level and the ground
               indicate that near-surface processes are active in the model.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Many physically-based models for climate change impact
               studies require sub-daily temporal resolution of the forcing
               data to provide meaningful predictions. However, climate
               scenarios are typically available at daily time step, severely
               limiting the application of such physically-based models. In
               this study, we propose an enhanced delta-change method for
               downscaling climate change scenarios from daily to hourly
               resolution. The approach presented provides objective criteria
               for assessing the quality of the determined delta and downscaled
               time series, while also fixing issues of common quantile mapping
               methods used for spatial downscaling related to the decrease of
               correlation between different variables. However, this new
               approach has limitations in correctly representing statistically
               extreme events and changes in the frequency of discontinuous
               events such as precipitation. Smoothing of historical and future
               data is required prior to applying the delta-change method, and
               the related parameters are found to have a subtle impact on the
               correctness of the representation of the seasonal means as well
               as the resulting (artificial) variability in the scenario data
               product. This new method is universal and can be applied with
               smoothing approaches apart from the harmonic fitting used in
               this work and in the past. In this study, the assessment
               suggested the use of seven harmonics for the smoothing of the
               input data as a best choice of this parameter for the data used.
               The method is applied to a Swiss climate change scenario data
               set, CH2018, and to a complement of this set to a Swiss alpine
               measurement network obtained by spatial transfer of CH2018,
               resulting in a set of 68 climate change scenarios at hourly
               resolution for 188 stations over Switzerland significantly

              determine snow precipitation rates via the calculated settling
              rates. This requires a rigid data control algorithm. A new
              statistical model is used to estimate fresh snow density as a
              function of the measured atmospheric conditions. A statistical
              model is also derived for the snow albedo, which is necessary to
              determine the absorbed radiation. The surface sensible and latent

              formulation, especially for the latent heat exchange, is crucial
              because latent heat exchange determines the formation of surface

              built on similar principles. The greatest differences are found
              in how each model parameterizes individual processes (e.g.,
              surface albedo and snow compaction). Parameterization choices
              naturally span a wide range of complexities. In this study, we
              evaluate the performance of different snow model
              parameterizations for hydrological applications using an existing
              multimodel energy-balance framework and data from two
              well-instrumented alpine sites with seasonal snow cover. We also
              include two temperature-index snow models and an intensive,
              physically based multilayer snow model in our analyses. Our
              results show that snow mass observations provide useful
              information for evaluating the ability of a model to predict
              snowpack runoff, whereas snow depth data alone are not. For snow
              mass and runoff, the energy-balance models appear transferable

              snow surface temperature predictions due to site-specificity of

              Model complexity was not a determinant for predicting daily

              models. The simpler solutions are inadequate for many problems,

              many problems, most notably high-resolution climate downscaling
              applications spanning large areas, long time periods, and many
              global climate projections. Here the Intermediate Complexity
              Atmospheric Research model (ICAR) is presented to provide a new
              step along the modeling complexity continuum. ICAR leverages an
              analytical solution for high-resolution perturbations to wind
              velocities, in conjunction with numerical physics schemes, that
              is, advection and cloud microphysics, to simulate the atmosphere.
              The focus of the initial development of ICAR is for predictions
              of precipitation, and eventually temperature, humidity, and

              regions is strongly influenced by the interactions between the

              processes and combines the more recent findings obtained from
              observations and modeling. The spatial variability of snow
              accumulation across multiple scales can be associated to
              wind-driven processes ranging from orographic precipitation at

              affected by wind-driven processes. Over continuous snow covers,
              turbulent fluxes of latent and sensible heat, as well as blowing
              snow sublimation, modify the mass, and energy balance of the
              snowpack and their representation in numerical models is
              associated with many uncertainties. As soon as the snow cover
              becomes patchy in spring local heat advection induces the
              development of stable internal boundary layers changing heat
              exchange toward the snow. Overall, wind-driven processes play a
              key role in all the different stages of the evolution of seasonal
              snow. Improvements in process understanding particularly at the
              mountain-ridge and the slope scale, and processes representations
              in models at scales up to the mountain range scale, will be the
              basis for improved short-term forecast and climate projections in
              snow-covered regions.",

              eastern U.S. As a result, water managers are keenly interested in
              their fate under climate change. However, previous studies of

              spacing over much of North America using the Weather Research and
              Forecasting (WRF) model. Two 13-year simulations were performed,
              consisting of a retrospective simulation (October 2000--September
              2013) with initial and boundary conditions from ERA-interim and a
              future climate sensitivity simulation with modified

              against Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) and an ensemble of gridded
              observational datasets. It shows overall good performance
              capturing the annual/seasonal/sub-seasonal precipitation and
              surface temperature climatology except for a summer dry and warm
              bias in the central U.S. In particular, the WRF seasonal
              precipitation agrees with SNOTEL observations within a few
              percent over the mountain ranges, providing confidence in the
              model's estimation of western U.S. seasonal snowfall and

              contiguous United States (CONUS), but suppresses summertime

  abstract  = "Abstract Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S),
               ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed,
               will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land
               surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis
               replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards)
               which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated
               Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016.
               ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model
               physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a
               significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31?km, compared
               to 80?km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and
               an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the
               horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up
               of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and
               performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which
               is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses
               show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to
               ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to
               assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and
               humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A
               comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit
               for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the
               evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced
               temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution
               of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation
               with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In
               general, low-frequency variability is found to be well
               represented and from 10?hPa downwards general patterns of
               anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim,

               climate models. As a result the climate model output must be
               downscaled, often using statistical methods. The plethora of

               in making an informed selection. We assess four commonly used
               statistical downscaling methods: daily and monthly
               disaggregated-to-daily Bias Corrected Spatial Disaggregation
               (BCSDd, BCSDm), Asynchronous Regression (AR), and Bias Corrected
               Constructed Analog (BCCA) as applied to a continental-scale
               domain and a regional domain (BCCAr). These methods are applied
               to the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, as a surrogate for a climate model,
               to downscale precipitation to a 12 km gridded observation data
               set. Skill is evaluated by comparing precipitation at daily,
               monthly, and annual temporal resolutions at individual grid
               cells and at aggregated scales. BCSDd and the BCCA methods
               overestimate wet day fraction, and underestimate extreme events.
               The AR method reproduces extreme events and wet day fraction
               well at the grid-cell scale, but over (under) estimates extreme
               events (wet day fraction) at aggregated scales. BCSDm reproduces
               extreme events and wet day fractions well at all space and time
               scales, but is limited to rescaling current weather patterns. In
               addition, we analyze the choice of calibration data set by
               looking at both a 12 km and a 6 km observational data set; the 6
               km observed data set has more wet days and smaller extreme
               events than the 12 km product, the opposite of expected scaling.",

              In particular the success of QM in mitigating systematic RCM

              precipitation amount, and derived indices of extremes by about
              one order of magnitude and strongly improves the shapes of the

               systematic deviations of the simulated historical data from
               observations. Methods are based on transfer functions generated
               to map the distribution of the simulated historical data to that
               of the observations. Those are subsequently applied to correct
               the future projections. Here, we present the bias correction
               method that was developed within ISI-MIP, the first
               Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project. ISI-MIP is
               designed to synthesise impact projections in the agriculture,
               water, biome, health, and infrastructure sectors at different
               levels of global warming. Bias-corrected climate data that are
               used as input for the impact simulations could be only provided
               over land areas. To ensure consistency with the global (land +
               ocean) temperature information the bias correction method has to
               preserve the warming signal. Here we present the applied method
               that preserves the absolute changes in monthly temperature, and
               relative changes in monthly values of precipitation and the
               other variables needed for ISI-MIP. The proposed methodology
               represents a modification of the transfer function approach
               applied in the Water Model Intercomparison Project (Water-MIP).
               Correction of the monthly mean is followed by correction of the

               discuss the potential and limitations of the applied bias
               correction. In particular, while the trend and the long-term
               mean are well represented, limitations with regards to the
               adjustment of the variability persist which may affect, e.g.
               small scale features or extremes.",

  abstract  = "Abstract. When applied to remove climate model biases in
               precipitation, quantile mapping can in some settings modify the
               simulated difference in mean precipitation between two eras.
               This has important implications when the precipitation is used
               to drive an impacts model that is sensitive to changes in
               precipitation. The tendency of quantile mapping to alter
               model-predicted changes is demonstrated using synthetic
               precipitation distributions and elucidated with a simple
               theoretical analysis, which shows that the alteration of
               model-predicted changes can be controlled by the ratio of model
               to observed variance. To further evaluate the effects of
               quantile mapping in a more realistic setting, we use daily
               precipitation output from 11 atmospheric general circulation
               models (AGCMs), forced by observed sea surface temperatures,
               over the conterminous United States to compare precipitation
               differences before and after quantile mapping bias correction.
               The effectiveness of the bias correction is not assessed, only
               its effect on precipitation differences. The change in seasonal
               mean (winter, DJF, and summer, JJA) precipitation between two
               historical periods is compared to examine whether the bias
               correction tends to amplify or diminish an AGCM's simulated
               precipitation change. In some cases the trend modification can
               be as large as the original simulated change, though the areas
               where this occurs varies among AGCMs so the ensemble median
               shows smaller trend modification. Results show that quantile
               mapping improves the correspondence with observed changes in
               some locations and degrades it in others. While not
               representative of a future where natural precipitation
               variability is much smaller than that due to external forcing,
               these results suggest that at least for the next several decades
               the influence of quantile mapping on seasonal precipitation
               trends does not systematically degrade projected differences.",

              scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with more simulations expected to

              different communities active in regional climate modelling,
              impact assessment and adaptation. The EURO-CORDEX ensemble
              results have been compared to the SRES A1B simulation results
              achieved within the ENSEMBLES project. The large-scale patterns
              of changes in mean temperature and precipitation are similar in
              all three scenarios, but they differ in regional details, which
              can partly be related to the higher resolution in EURO-CORDEX.
              The results strengthen those obtained in ENSEMBLES, but need
              further investigations. The analysis of impact indices shows that
              for RCP8.5, there is a substantially larger change projected for
              temperature-based indices than for RCP4.5. The difference is less
              pronounced for precipitation-based indices. Two effects of the
              increased resolution can be regarded as an added value of
              regional climate simulations. Regional climate model simulations
              provide higher daily precipitation intensities, which are
              completely missing in the global climate model simulations, and
              they provide a significantly different climate change of daily

               projections to force impact models. Increasingly, time series
               with daily resolution are used, which require high consistency,
               for instance with respect to transition probabilities (TPs)
               between wet and dry days and spell durations. However, both
               climate models and commonly applied statistical tools have
               considerable uncertainties and drawbacks. This paper compares
               the ability of 1) raw regional climate model (RCM) output, 2)
               bias-corrected RCM output, and 3) a conventional weather
               generator (WG) that has been calibrated to match observed TPs to
               simulate the sequence of dry, wet, and very wet days at a set of
               long-term weather stations across Switzerland. The study finds
               systematic biases in TPs and spell lengths for raw RCM output,

               deterministic quantile mapping technique. For the region

               observations in terms of TPs as well as dry and wet spell
               durations. For the majority of cases (models and stations)
               bias-corrected climate model output is similar in skill to a
               simple Markov chain stochastic weather generator. There is
               strong evidence that bias-corrected climate model simulations

               data for driving fine-scale models requires downscaling of
               near-surface (e.g., 2m high) air temperature. Existing
               approaches describe lapse rates well but differ in how they
               include surface effects, i.e., the difference between the
               simulated 2m and upper-air temperatures. We show that different
               treatment of surface effects result in some methods making
               better predictions in valleys while others are better in summit
               areas. We propose the downscaling method REDCAPP (REanalysis
               Downscaling Cold Air Pooling Parameterization) with a spatially
               variable magnitude of surface effects. Results are evaluated
               with observations (395 stations) from two mountain regions and

               the difference between near-surface air temperature and
               pressure-level temperature ($\Delta$T) is a good proxy of
               surface effects. It can be used with a spatially variable

               results, especially in valleys with strong surface effects and

               applications. This study presents a systematic investigation of
               the relationship between point observations and areal mean snow
               depths ranging from the scale of tens of metres to entire
               catchments. We analyse aerial snow depth information from four
               mountain regions in the European Alps, one in the Spanish
               Pyrenees and one in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, obtained from
               airborne laser scanning surveys. This rich data set allowed to
               compare point values with snow cover statistics, reflecting the
               real snow depth distribution of the investigation areas. We
               present two contrasting approaches in order to assess the
               representativeness of typical flat-field snow depth
               measurements. In the first approach, we define potential index
               stations based on topographic characteristics as commonly
               applied for snow cover monitoring stations. The point
               observations of these index stations are then compared with the
               mean values in their vicinities. We show that most of the index
               stations strongly overestimate the snow depth of the catchment
               and of their surrounding area at distances of several hundreds
               of metres. Results confirm the expectation that the larger the
               support area, the smaller the difference to the mean of the
               complete catchment. The second approach was to analyse
               topographic characteristics of all cells with snow depths that
               deviated less than 10\% from the catchment mean. It appears that
               these representative cells are rather randomly distributed and
               cannot be identified a priori. In summary, our results show
               large potential biases of index stations with respect to snow
               distribution and therefore also snow water equivalent. Copyright

               applied over High Mountain Asia (HMA), using a newly developed
               snow reanalysis method. Starting from an ``uninformed'' prior
               probability distribution, a posterior scaling factor applied to
               MERRA-2 snowfall was derived by constraining model-based
               estimates of seasonal snow accumulation and ablation over the
               water year (WY) with fractional snow covered area (fSCA)
               measurements derived from Landsat and MODIS (MODSCAG). Several
               sub-domains (nine representative 1° by 1° tiles) across HMA were
               examined over the period WYs 2001--2015 and compiled into an
               uncertainty parameterization where a lognormal distribution was
               fitted to the empirical posterior distribution with a mean of
               1.54 (median of 1.19) and coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.83,
               indicating that MERRA-2 underestimates snowfall on average by
               ∼54\% with sizeable uncertainty. For reference, the
               uncertainties in snowfall precipitation from the ERA5 and
               APHRODITE-2 precipitation products were also evaluated, and
               these products were found to underestimate snowfall, on average
               by a factor around 1.78 and 3.34 (with median scaling factors of
               1.42 and 2.51), respectively. The results indicate that snowfall
               precipitation at high-elevations dominated by snowfall is
               underestimated in most existing products, especially in the
               gauge-based APHRODITE-2 product, where the biases were also
               found to exhibit geographical variations with the largest
               underestimation in monsoon-influenced high-elevation tiles. The
               derived MERRA-2 uncertainty model is being used to develop a
               full domain-wide HMA snow reanalysis, which will shed further
               light onto the space-time variations in snowfall biases in these
               products.",

  abstract  = "Abstract. Rapid changes are occurring in the Arctic, including a
               reduction in sea ice thickness and coverage and a shift towards
               younger and thinner sea ice. Snow and sea ice models are often
               used to study these ongoing changes in the Arctic, and are
               typically forced by atmospheric reanalyses in absence of
               observations. ERA5 is a new global reanalysis that will replace
               the widely used ERA-Interim (ERA-I). In this study, we compare
               the 2 m air temperature (T2M), snowfall (SF) and total
               precipitation (TP) from ERA-I and ERA5, and evaluate these
               products using buoy observations from Arctic sea ice for the
               years 2010 to 2016. We further assess how biases in reanalyses
               can influence the snow and sea ice evolution in the Arctic, when
               used to force a thermodynamic sea ice model. We find that ERA5
               is generally warmer than ERA-I in winter and spring (0--1.2 ∘C),
               but colder than ERA-I in summer and autumn (0--0.6 ∘C) over
               Arctic sea ice. Both reanalyses have a warm bias over Arctic sea
               ice relative to buoy observations. The warm bias is smaller in
               the warm season, and larger in the cold season, especially when
               the T2M is below −25 ∘C in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors.
               Interestingly, the warm bias for ERA-I and new ERA5 is on
               average 3.4 and 5.4 ∘C (daily mean), respectively, when T2M is
               lower than −25 ∘C. The TP and SF along the buoy trajectories and
               over Arctic sea ice are consistently higher in ERA5 than in
               ERA-I. Over Arctic sea ice, the TP in ERA5 is typically less
               than 10 mm snow water equivalent (SWE) greater than in ERA-I in
               any of the seasons, while the SF in ERA5 can be 50 mm SWE higher
               than in ERA-I in a season. The largest increase in annual TP
               (40--100 mm) and SF (100--200 mm) in ERA5 occurs in the Atlantic
               sector. The SF to TP ratio is larger in ERA5 than in ERA-I, on
               average 0.6 for ERA-I and 0.8 for ERA5 along the buoy
               trajectories. Thus, the substantial anomalous Arctic rainfall in
               ERA-I is reduced in ERA5, especially in summer and autumn.
               Simulations with a 1-D thermodynamic sea ice model demonstrate
               that the warm bias in ERA5 acts to reduce thermodynamic ice
               growth. The higher precipitation and snowfall in ERA5 results in
               a thicker snowpack that allows less heat loss to the atmosphere.
               Thus, the larger winter warm bias and higher precipitation in
               ERA5, compared with ERA-I, result in thinner ice thickness at
               the end of the growth season when using ERA5; however the effect
               is small during the freezing period.",

  abstract  = "Abstract. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) region, often referred to as
               the Third Pole, is the world's highest plateau and exerts a
               considerable influence on regional and global climate. The state
               of the snowpack over the TP is a major research focus due to its
               great impact on the headwaters of a dozen major Asian rivers.
               While many studies have attempted to validate atmospheric
               reanalyses over the TP area in terms of temperature or
               precipitation, there have been -- remarkably -- no studies aimed
               at systematically comparing the snow depth or snow cover in
               global reanalyses with satellite and in situ data. Yet, snow in
               reanalyses provides critical surface information for forecast
               systems from the medium to sub-seasonal timescales. Here, snow
               depth and snow cover from four recent global reanalysis
               products, namely the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
               Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 and ERA-Interim reanalyses, the Japanese
               55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) and the NASA Modern-Era
               Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2),
               are inter-compared over the TP region. The reanalyses are
               evaluated against a set of 33 in situ station observations, as
               well as against the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping
               System (IMS) snow cover and a satellite microwave snow depth
               dataset. The high temporal correlation coefficient (0.78)
               between the IMS snow cover and the in situ observations provides
               confidence in the station data despite the relative paucity of
               in situ measurement sites and the harsh operating conditions.
               While several reanalyses show a systematic overestimation of the
               snow depth or snow cover, the reanalyses that assimilate local
               in situ observations or IMS snow cover are better capable of
               representing the shallow, transient snowpack over the TP region.
               The latter point is clearly demonstrated by examining the family
               of reanalyses from the ECMWF, of which only the older
               ERA-Interim assimilated IMS snow cover at high altitudes, while
               ERA5 did not consider IMS snow cover for high altitudes. We
               further tested the sensitivity of the ERA5-Land model in offline
               experiments, assessing the impact of blown snow sublimation,
               snow cover to snow depth conversion and, more importantly,
               excessive snowfall. These results suggest that excessive
               snowfall might be the primary factor for the large
               overestimation of snow depth and cover in ERA5 reanalysis.
               Pending a solution for this common model precipitation bias over
               the Himalayas and the TP, future snow reanalyses that optimally
               combine the use of satellite snow cover and in situ snow depth
               observations in the assimilation and analysis cycles have the
               potential to improve medium-range to sub-seasonal forecasts for
               water resources applications.",

  abstract = "Impact models are a major source of information for quantifying
              the consequences of future climate change for humans and the
              environment. To provide plausible outputs, these models require
              unbiased high resolution meteorological data as input for
              atmospheric conditions. State of the art regional climate models
              (RCMs) often fail to provide such data, since they can exhibit
              large systematic biases.Therefore, bias correction methods (BCMs)
              have become a common tool in climate impact studies. Bias
              correction, however, comes with strong assumptions and
              limitations, often resulting from the fact that most BCMs are
              unable to appropriately calibrate a time dependent and
              conditional transfer function. To address this problem, we
              introduce here regression quantile mapping (RQM), a bias
              correction approach based on (linear) regression models which
              allow to design transfer functions based on expert knowledge. The
              new RQM algorithm is described in full detail in its basic
              (linear model) version and applied to RCM generated precipitation
              data for entire Europe. Based on the latter example, we provide a
              thorough comparison with another established BCM, quantile delta
              mapping (QDM) regarding the seasonal characteristics of
              precipitation sums. Our results demonstrate that RQM already
              achieves good results when a simple linear model is used. The
              relationship between precipitation and temperature was properly
              evaluated by RQM and representation of seasonal variations and
              key characteristics of precipitation were improved for most
              seasons. Systematic biases where reduced significantly during
              this process. Particular improvements in comparison with QDM are
              found regarding the shape and width of the distribution of bias
              corrected model precipitation. Furthermore, the representation of
              precipitation extremes within the data was largely improved when
              RQM was used instead of QDM.",

              application of DECMs are demonstrated. Direct point-wise methods
              like quantile mapping and local intensity scaling as well as
              indirect spatial methods as nonlinear analogue methods yield

               regional climate models (RCMs) are commonly used to transfer
               large-scale global climate model (GCM) data to smaller scales
               and to provide more detailed regional information. Due to
               systematic and random model errors, however, RCM simulations
               often show considerable deviations from observations. This has
               led to the development of a number of correction approaches that
               rely on the assumption that RCM errors do not change over time.
               It is in principle not possible to test whether this underlying
               assumption of error stationarity is actually fulfilled for
               future climate conditions. In this study, however, we
               demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate how well correction
               methods perform for conditions different from those used for
               calibration with the relatively simple differential split-sample

               differential split-sample tests by dividing the data series into
               cold and warm respective dry and wet years. This enabled us to
               cross-evaluate the performance of different correction
               procedures under systematically varying climate conditions. The
               differential split-sample test identified major differences in
               the ability of the applied correction methods to reduce model
               errors and to cope with non-stationary biases. More advanced
               correction methods performed better, whereas large deviations
               remained for climate model simulations corrected with simpler
               approaches. Therefore, we question the use of simple correction
               methods such as the widely used delta-change approach and linear
               transformation for RCM-based climate-change impact studies.
               Instead, we recommend using higher-skill correction methods such

  abstract = "ABSTRACT Observed and projected climatic changes demand for
              robust assessments of climate impacts on various environmental
              and anthropogenic systems. Empirical-statistical downscaling
              (ESD) methods coupled to output from climate model projections
              are promising tools to assess impacts at regional to local scale.
              ESD methods correct for common model deficiencies in accuracy
              (e.g. model biases) and scale (e.g. grid vs point scale).
              However, most ESD methods require long observational time series
              at the target sites, and this often restricts robust impact
              assessments to a small number of sites. This paper presents a
              method to generate robust climate model based scenarios for
              target sites with short and (or) sparse observational data
              coverage. The approach is based on the well-established quantile
              mapping method and incorporates two major steps: (1) climate
              model bias correction to the most representative station with
              long-term measurements and (2) spatial transfer of bias-corrected
              model data to represent target site characteristics. Both steps
              are carried out using the quantile mapping technique. The
              resulting output can serve as end user?tailored input for climate
              impact models. The method allows for multivariate and multi-model
              ensemble scenarios and additionally enables to approximately
              reconstruct data for non-measured periods. The method's
              applicability is validated using (1) long-term weather stations
              across the topographically and climatologically complex territory
              of Switzerland and (2) sparse data sets from Swiss permafrost
              research sites located in challenging conditions at high
              altitudes. It is shown that the two-step approach performs well
              and offers attractive quality, even for extreme target locations.
              Uncertainties, however, remain and primarily depend on (1) data
              availability and (2) the considered variable. The two-step
              approach itself involves large uncertainties when applied to
              short reference data sets or spatially heterogeneous variables
              (e.g. precipitation, wind speed). For temperature, results are
              promising even when using very short calibration periods.",

  abstract = "Six approaches for downscaling climate model outputs for use in
              hydrologic simulation were evaluated, with particular emphasis on
              each method's ability to produce precipitation and other
              variables used to drive a macroscale hydrology model applied at
              much higher spatial resolution than the climate model.
              Comparisons were made on the basis of a twenty-year retrospective
              (1975--1995) climate simulation produced by the NCAR-DOE Parallel
              ClimateModel (PCM), and the implications of the comparison for a
              future(2040--2060) PCM climate scenario were also explored. The
              six approaches were made up of three relatively simple
              statistical downscaling methods -- linear interpolation (LI),
              spatial disaggregation (SD), and bias-correction and spatial
              disaggregation (BCSD) -- each applied to both PCM output
              directly(at T42 spatial resolution), and after dynamical
              downscaling via a Regional Climate Model (RCM -- at 1/2-degree
              spatial resolution), for downscaling the climate model outputs to
              the 1/8-degree spatial resolution of the hydrological model. For
              the retrospective climate simulation, results were compared to an
              observed gridded climatology of temperature and precipitation,
              and gridded hydrologic variables resulting from forcing the
              hydrologic model with observations. The most significant findings
              are that the BCSD method was successful in reproducing the main
              features of the observed hydrometeorology from the retrospective
              climate simulation, when applied to both PCM and RCM outputs.
              Linear interpolation produced better results using RCM output
              than PCM output, but both methods (PCM-LI and RCM-LI) lead to
              unacceptably biased hydrologic simulations. Spatial
              disaggregation of the PCM output produced results similar to
              those achieved with the RCM interpolated output; nonetheless,
              neither PCM nor RCM output was useful for hydrologic simulation
              purposes without a bias-correction step. For the future climate
              scenario, only the BCSD-method (using PCM or RCM) was able to
              produce hydrologically plausible results. With the BCSD method,
              the RCM-derived hydrology was more sensitive to climate change
              than the PCM-derived hydrology.",

              that aims to provide high-resolution climate scenarios for
              Europe. Here an evaluation of the ERA-Interim-driven EURO-CORDEX
              regional climate model (RCM) ensemble is presented. The study
              documents the performance of the individual models in
              representing the basic spatiotemporal patterns of the European
              climate for the period 1989--2008. Model evaluation focuses on
              near-surface air temperature and precipitation, and uses the
              E-OBS data set as observational reference. The ensemble consists
              of 17 simulations carried out by seven different models at grid
              resolutions of 12 km (nine experiments) and 50 km (eight
              experiments). Several performance metrics computed from monthly
              and seasonal mean values are used to assess model performance
              over eight subdomains of the European continent. Results are
              compared to those for the ERA40-driven ENSEMBLES simulations. The
              analysis confirms the ability of RCMs to capture the basic
              features of the European climate, including its variability in
              space and time. But it also identifies nonnegligible deficiencies
              of the simulations for selected metrics, regions and seasons.
              Seasonally and regionally averaged temperature biases are mostly
              smaller than 1.5 °C, while precipitation biases are typically
              located in the $\pm$40\% range. Some bias characteristics, such
              as a predominant cold and wet bias in most seasons and over most
              parts of Europe and a warm and dry summer bias over southern and
              southeastern Europe reflect common model biases. For seasonal
              mean quantities averaged over large European subdomains, no clear
              benefit of an increased spatial resolution (12 vs. 50 km) can be
              identified. The bias ranges of the EURO-CORDEX ensemble mostly
              correspond to those of the ENSEMBLES simulations, but some
              improvements in model performance can be identified (e.g., a less
              pronounced southern European warm summer bias). The temperature
              bias spread across different configurations of one individual
              model can be of a similar magnitude as the spread across
              different models, demonstrating a strong influence of the
              specific choices in physical parameterizations and experimental
              setup on model performance. Based on a number of simply
              reproducible metrics, the present study quantifies the currently
              achievable accuracy of RCMs used for regional climate simulations

              Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX)
              initiative. The first set of simulations with a horizontal
              resolution of 12.5 km was completed for the new emission
              scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with more simulations expected to

              different communities active in regional climate modelling,
              impact assessment and adaptation. The EURO-CORDEX ensemble
              results have been compared to the SRES A1B simulation results
              achieved within the ENSEMBLES project. The large-scale patterns
              of changes in mean temperature and precipitation are similar in
              all three scenarios, but they differ in regional details, which
              can partly be related to the higher resolution in EURO-CORDEX.
              The results strengthen those obtained in ENSEMBLES, but need
              further investigations. The analysis of impact indices shows that
              for RCP8.5, there is a substantially larger change projected for
              temperature-based indices than for RCP4.5. The difference is less
              pronounced for precipitation-based indices. Two effects of the
              increased resolution can be regarded as an added value of
              regional climate simulations. Regional climate model simulations
              provide higher daily precipitation intensities, which are
              completely missing in the global climate model simulations, and
              they provide a significantly different climate change of daily
              precipitation intensities resulting in a smoother shift from weak
              to moderate and high intensities.",

ABSTRACT={Temperature plays an important role in electricity demand and generation; heat waves and cold waves represent potential threats to the energy system due to the sustained nature of such events. In the current climate change context, it is important to anticipate possible changes in the occurrence of the most severe events to adapt energy system planning and management. However, because such events are rare, any estimation of their frequency is uncertain and a very large data sample is required to reduce any sampling uncertainty. In this paper, a way of expanding multimodel or single-model ensembles in order to produce a much larger ensemble of temporal evolutions of a temperature based indicator, is presented. This ensemble can then be used to statistically estimate the occurrence and occurrence changes in time of the most extreme events. The generation of additional time series is made by use of a stochastic weather generator designed for the simulation of the stochastic residuals once the trends and seasonalities in mean and standard deviation of the temperature have been removed. The approach is first described and applied to an observed 32-station weighted average temperature time series in France, used as an indicator for the role of temperature in electricity demand, in a cross-validation setting. Using the observed time series of this thermal indicator over the period 1950–2017, the approach is calibrated over the period 1955–1986 to generate similar time series over the whole period 1955–2017 using different CMIP5 Global Climate Model simulations. Then the generated set of time series are validated for the mean annual cycle and distributions of heat waves and cold waves over the period 1987–2017. The choices made for generation and reconstruction are detailed and motivated. The methodology is used to generate a large set of indicator evolutions covering recent past and near future periods, which is used to identify changes in the frequencies of the most severe heat waves or cold waves. The increased frequency of very severe heat waves is found in agreement with previous studies, and estimates of the decreased frequency of the most severe cold waves are also provided.}

              order to perform landscape-scale assessments of earth systems.
              This task is problematic in complex terrain due to (i)
              high-resolution grids required to capture strong lateral
              variability, and (ii) lack of meteorological forcing data where
              they are required. In this study we test a topography and climate
              processor, which is designed for use with large-area land surface
              simulation, in complex and remote terrain. The scheme is driven
              entirely by globally available data sets. We simulate air
              temperature, ground surface temperature and snow depth and test
              the model with a large network of measurements in the Swiss Alps.
              We obtain root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values of 0.64 °C for
              air temperature, 0.67--1.34 °C for non-bedrock ground surface
              temperature, and 44.5 mm for snow depth, which is likely affected
              by poor input precipitation field. Due to this we trial a simple
              winter precipitation correction method based on melt dates of the
              snowpack. We present a test application of the scheme in the
              context of simulating mountain permafrost. The scheme produces a

               variability of the snow depth distribution present in alpine
               terrain. Continuous and accurate snow depth mapping has been
               successfully performed using laser scanning but this method can
               only cover limited areas and is expensive. We use the airborne
               ADS80 optoelectronic scanner, acquiring stereo imagery with 0.25
               m spatial resolution to derive digital surface models (DSMs) of

               heterogeneous terrain due to the the high resolution required of
               model grids to capture strong lateral variability caused by, for
               example, topography, and the lack of accurate meteorological
               forcing data at the site or scale it is required. Gridded data
               products produced by atmospheric models can fill this gap,
               however, often not at an appropriate spatial resolution to drive
               land-surface simulations. In this study we describe a method
               that uses the well-resolved description of the atmospheric
               column provided by climate models, together with high-resolution
               digital elevation models (DEMs), to downscale coarse-grid
               climate variables to a fine-scale subgrid. The main aim of this
               approach is to provide high-resolution driving data for a
               land-surface model (LSM). The method makes use of an
               interpolation of pressure-level data according to topographic
               height of the subgrid. An elevation and topography correction is
               used to downscale short-wave radiation. Long-wave radiation is
               downscaled by deriving a cloud-component of all-sky emissivity
               at grid level and using downscaled temperature and relative
               humidity fields to describe variability with elevation.
               Precipitation is downscaled with a simple non-linear lapse and
               optionally disaggregated using a climatology approach. We test
               the method in comparison with unscaled grid-level data and a set
               of reference methods, against a large evaluation dataset (up to
               210 stations per variable) in the Swiss Alps. We demonstrate
               that the method can be used to derive meteorological inputs in
               complex terrain, with most significant improvements (with
               respect to reference methods) seen in variables derived from
               pressure levels: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed
               and incoming long-wave radiation. This method may be of use in
               improving inputs to numerical simulations in heterogeneous
               and/or remote terrain, especially when statistical methods are
               not possible, due to lack of observations (i.e. remote areas or

              Distribution (SSNOWD) submodel that explicitly includes subgrid
              snow-depth and snow-cover variability has been developed. From
              both atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives, the subgrid
              snow-depth distribution is an important quantity to account for
              within large-scale models. In the natural system, these subgrid
              snow-depth distributions are largely responsible for the mosaic
              of snow-covered and snow-free areas that develop as the snow
              melts, and the impacts of these fractional areas must be
              quantified in order to realistically simulate grid-averaged
              surface fluxes. SSNOWD's formulation incorporates observational
              studies showing that snow distributions can be described by a
              lognormal distribution and the snow-depth coefficient of
              variation. Using an understanding of the physical processes that
              lead to these observed snow-depth variations, a global
              distribution of nine subgrid snow-depth-variability categories
              was developed, and coefficient-of-variation values were assigned
              to each category based on published measurements. In addition,
              SSNOWD adopts the physically realistic approach of performing
              separate surface-energy-balance calculations over the
              snow-covered and snow-free portions of each model grid cell and
              weighing the resulting fluxes according to these fractional

              Modeling System (ClimRAMS) over a North American domain, SSNOWD
              was compared with a snow-cover formulation similar to those
              currently used in most general circulation models. The
              simulations indicated that accounting for snow-distribution
              variability has a significant impact on snow-cover evolution and

               storing capacity, snow strongly modulates the surface energy and
               water balance, which makes it a critical factor in mid- to
               high-latitude and mountain environments. However, estimating the
               snow water equivalent (SWE) is challenging in remote-sensing
               applications already at medium spatial resolutions of 1 km. We
               present an ensemble-based data assimilation framework that
               estimates the peak subgrid SWE distribution (SSD) at the 1 km
               scale by assimilating fractional snow-covered area (fSCA)
               satellite retrievals in a simple snow model forced by downscaled
               reanalysis data. The basic idea is to relate the timing of the
               snow cover depletion (accessible from satellite products) to the
               peak SSD. Peak subgrid SWE is assumed to be lognormally
               distributed, which can be translated to a modeled time series of
               fSCA through the snow model. Assimilation of satellite-derived
               fSCA facilitates the estimation of the peak SSD, while taking
               into account uncertainties in both the model and the assimilated
               data sets. As an extension to previous studies, our method makes
               use of the novel (to snow data assimilation) ensemble smoother
               with multiple data assimilation (ES-MDA) scheme combined with
               analytical Gaussian anamorphosis to assimilate time series of
               Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and

               sites near Ny-{\AA}lesund (79° N, Svalbard, Norway) where field
               measurements of fSCA and SWE distributions are available. The
               method is able to successfully recover accurate estimates of
               peak SSD on most of the occasions considered. Through the ES-MDA
               assimilation, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the fSCA,
               peak mean SWE and peak subgrid coefficient of variation is
               improved by around 75, 60 and 20 \%, respectively, when compared

               (w.e.) and 0.13, respectively. The ES-MDA either outperforms or
               at least nearly matches the performance of other ensemble-based
               batch smoother schemes with regards to various evaluation
               metrics. Given the modularity of the method, it could prove

              sensed fractional snow-covered area fSCA. The newly proposed
              approach consists of a particle batch smoother (PBS), which is
              compared to a previously applied Kalman-based ensemble batch
              smoother (EnBS) approach. The methods were applied over the 27-yr
              Landsat 5 record at snow pillow and snow course in situ
              verification sites in the American River basin in the Sierra
              Nevada (United States). This basin is more densely vegetated and
              thus more challenging for SWE estimation than the previous
              applications of the EnBS. Both data assimilation methods provided
              significant improvement over the prior (modeling only) estimates,
              with both able to significantly reduce prior SWE biases. The
              prior RMSE values at the snow pillow and snow course sites were
              reduced by 68\%--82\% and 60\%--68\%, respectively, when applying
              the data assimilation methods. This result is encouraging for a
              basin like the American where the moderate to high forest cover
              will necessarily obscure more of the snow-covered ground surface
              than in previously examined, less-vegetated basins. The PBS
              generally outperformed the EnBS: for snow pillows the PBS RMSE
              was ~54\% of that seen in the EnBS, while for snow courses the
              PBS RMSE was ~79\% of the EnBS. Sensitivity tests show relative
              insensitivity for both the PBS and EnBS results to ensemble size
              and fSCA measurement error, but a higher sensitivity for the EnBS
              to the mean prior precipitation input, especially in the case

               distributed hydrological models is a possible source of
               improvement of snowmelt-related floods. In this study, the

  abstract = "Abstract We develop a permafrost classification system to
              describe the complex interaction of climatic and ecological
              processes in permafrost formation and degradation that
              differentiates five patterns of formation: ?climate-driven?;
              ?climate-driven, ecosystem-modified?; ?climate-driven,
              ecosystem-protected?; ?ecosystem-driven?; and
              ?ecosystem-protected? permafrost. Climate-driven permafrost
              develops in the continuous permafrost zone, where permafrost
              forms immediately after the surface is exposed to the atmosphere
              and even under shallow water. Climate-driven, ecosystem-modified
              permafrost occurs in the continuous permafrost zone when
              vegetation succession and organic-matter accumulation lead to
              development of an ice-rich layer at the top of the permafrost.
              During warming climates, permafrost that has formed as
              climate-driven can occur in the discontinuous permafrost zone,
              where it can persist for a long time as ecosystem-protected.
              Climate-driven, ecosystem protected permafrost, and its
              associated ground ice, cannot re-establish in the discontinuous
              zone once degraded, although the near surface can recover as
              ecosystem-driven permafrost. Ecosystem-driven permafrost forms in
              the discontinuous permafrost zone in poorly drained, low-lying
              and north-facing landscape conditions, and under strong ecosystem
              influence. Finally, ecosystem-protected permafrost persists as
              sporadic patches under warmer climates, but cannot be
              re-established after disturbance. These distinctions are
              important because the various types react differently to climate
              change and surface disturbances. For example, climate-driven,
              ecosystem-modified permafrost can experience thermokarst even
              under cold conditions because of its ice-rich layer formed during
              ecosystem development, and ecosystem-driven permafrost is
              unlikely to recover after disturbance, such as fire, if there is
              sufficient climate warming. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley \& Sons,

              provide satellite-based global observations of surface (0?5 cm)
              soil moisture. In previous work an ensemble Kalman filter was
              used to estimate soil moisture, related states, and fluxes by
              merging noisy low-frequency microwave observations with the
              forecasts from a conventional yet uncertain land surface model.
              Kalman filter estimates are only conditioned on observations
              prior to estimation times. Here it is argued that soil moisture
              estimation is a reanalysis-type problem as observations beyond
              the estimation time are useful in the estimation. An ensemble
              smoother is used in which the state vector and measurement vector
              are distributed in time and updated as a batch. Its performance
              in a land data assimilation context is compared to that of the
              ensemble Kalman filter. Results demonstrate that smoothing yields
              an improved estimate compared to filtering, reflected in the
              decreased deviation from truth and the reduction in uncertainty
              associated with the estimate. Precipitation significantly impacts
              the performance of the smoother, acting as an information barrier

              presented in which brightness temperature is used to break the
              study interval into a series of dry-down events. The smoother is
              used on dry-down events, and the filter is used when
              precipitation is evident between estimation times. An improved
              estimate is obtained as all observations in a given dry-down
              period are used to estimate soil moisture in that period, and
              backward propagation of information from subsequent precipitation

  abstract = "The presence of seasonal snow cover during the cold season of the
              annual air temperature cycle has significant influence on the
              ground thermal regime in cold regions. Snow has high albedo and
              emissivity that cool the snow surface, high absorptivity that
              tends to warm the snow surface, low thermal conductivity so that
              a snow layer acts as an insulator, and high latent heat due to
              snowmelt that is a heat sink. The overall impact of snow cover on
              the ground thermal regime depends on the timing, duration,
              accumulation, and melting processes of seasonal snow cover;
              density, structure, and thickness of seasonal snow cover; and
              interactions of snow cover with micrometeorological conditions,
              local microrelief, vegetation, and the geographical locations.
              Over different timescales either the cooling or warming impact of
              seasonal snow cover may dominate. In the continuous permafrost
              regions, impact of seasonal snow cover can result in an increase
              of the mean annual ground and permafrost surface temperature by
              several degrees, whereas in discontinuous and sporadic permafrost
              regions the absence of seasonal snow cover may be a key factor
              for permafrost development. In seasonally frozen ground regions,
              snow cover can substantially reduce the seasonal freezing depth.
              However, the influence of seasonal snow cover on seasonally
              frozen ground has received relatively little attention, and
              further study is needed. Ground surface temperatures,
              reconstructed from deep borehole temperature gradients, have
              increased by up to 4°C in the past centuries and have been widely
              used as evidence of paleoclimate change. However, changes in air
              temperature alone cannot account for the changes in ground
              temperatures. Changes in seasonal snow conditions might have
              significantly contributed to the ground surface temperature
              increase. The influence of seasonal snow cover on soil
              temperature, soil freezing and thawing processes, and permafrost

              objective of obtaining high-resolution retrospective snow water
              equivalent (SWE) estimates over several Andean study basins. The
              framework integrates Landsat fractional snow covered area (fSCA)
              images, a land surface and snow depletion model, and the Modern
              Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)
              reanalysis as a forcing data set. The outputs are SWE and fSCA
              fields (1985?2015) at a resolution of 90 m that are consistent
              with the observed depletion record. Verification using in-situ
              snow surveys showed significant improvements in the accuracy of
              the SWE estimates relative to forward model estimates, with
              increases in correlation (0.49?0.87) and reductions in root mean
              square error (0.316 m to 0.129 m) and mean error (?0.221 m to
              0.009 m). A sensitivity analysis showed that the framework is
              robust to variations in physiography, fSCA data availability and
              a priori precipitation biases. Results from the application to
              the headwater basin of the Aconcagua River showed how the forward
              model versus the fSCA-conditioned estimate resulted in different
              quantifications of the relationship between runoff and SWE, and
              different correlation patterns between pixel-wise SWE and ENSO.
              The illustrative results confirm the influence that ENSO has on
              snow accumulation for Andean basins draining into the Pacific,
              with ENSO explaining approximately 25\% of the variability in
              near-peak (1 September) SWE values. Our results show how the
              assimilation of fSCA data results in a significant improvement
              upon MERRA-forced modeled SWE estimates, further increasing the

              systems to improve the skill of forecasts for better informed
              real-world decision making. This is due in part to a lack of
              mechanisms to properly quantify the uncertainty in observations
              and forecast models in real-time forecasting situations and to
              conduct the merging of data and models in a way that is
              adequately efficient and transparent to operational forecasters.
              The need for effective DA of useful hydrologic data into the
              forecast process has become increasingly recognized in recent
              years. This motivated a hydrologic DA workshop in Delft, the
              Netherlands in November 2010, which focused on advancing DA in
              operational hydrologic forecasting and water resources
              management. As an outcome of the workshop, this paper reviews, in
              relevant detail, the current status of DA applications in both
              hydrologic research and operational practices, and discusses the
              existing or potential hurdles and challenges in transitioning
              hydrologic DA research into cost-effective operational
              forecasting tools, as well as the potential pathways and newly
              emerging opportunities for overcoming these challenges. Several
              related aspects are discussed, including (1) theoretical or
              mathematical aspects in DA algorithms, (2) the estimation of

              objective use in hydrologic DA, (4) the use of DA for real-time

              is recommended that cost-effective transition of hydrologic DA

              Alps of New Zealand. In addition, area-averaged simulations of
              SWE based on different types of spatial discretization are
              evaluated. Spatial variability of SWE is shaped by a range of
              different processes that occur across a hierarchy of spatial
              scales. Spatial variability at the watershed-scale is shaped by
              variability in near-surface meteorological fields (e.g.,
              elevation gradients in temperature) and, provided suitable
              meteorological data is available, can be explicitly resolved by
              spatial interpolation/extrapolation. On the other hand, spatial
              variability of SWE at the hillslope-scale is governed by
              processes such as drifting, sloughing of snow off steep slopes,
              trapping of snow by shrubs, and the nonuniform unloading of snow
              by the forest canopy, which are more difficult to resolve

              introduction of a Richards equation (RE) solver as an alternative
              for the bucket-type approach for describing water transport in
              the snow and soil layers. In addition, continuous updates of snow
              settling and new snow density parameterizations have changed
              model behavior. This study presents a detailed evaluation of
              model performance against a comprehensive multiyear data set from
              Weissfluhjoch near Davos, Switzerland. The data set is collected
              by automatic meteorological and snowpack measurements and manual
              snow profiles. During the main winter season, snow height (RMSE:
              < 4.2 cm), snow water equivalent (SWE, RMSE: < 40 mm w.e.), snow
              temperature distributions (typical deviation with measurements: <
              1.0 °C) and snow density (typical deviation with observations: <
              50 kg m−3) as well as their temporal evolution are well simulated
              in the model and the influence of the two water transport schemes
              is small. The RE approach reproduces internal differences over
              capillary barriers but fails to predict enough grain growth since
              the growth routines have been calibrated using the bucket scheme
              in the original SNOWPACK model. However, the agreement in both
              density and grain size is sufficient to parameterize the
              hydraulic properties successfully. In the melt season, a
              pronounced underestimation of typically 200 mm w.e. in SWE is
              found. The discrepancies between the simulations and the field
              data are generally larger than the differences between the two
              water transport schemes. Nevertheless, the detailed comparison of
              the internal snowpack structure shows that the timing of internal
              temperature and water dynamics is adequately and better
              represented with the new RE approach when compared to the
              conventional bucket scheme. On the contrary, the progress of the
              meltwater front in the snowpack as detected by radar and the
              temporal evolution of the vertical distribution of melt forms in
              manually observed snow profiles do not support this conclusion.

              Permafrost in steep bedrock is an emerging field of research.
              Knowledge of rock temperatures, ice content, mechanisms of
              degradation, and the processes that link warming and
              destabilization is often fragmental. In this article we provide a
              review and discussion of existing literature and pinpoint
              important questions. Ice?filled joints are common in bedrock
              permafrost and possibly actively widened by ice segregation.
              Broad evidence of destabilization by warming permafrost exists
              despite problems of attributing individual events to this
              phenomenon with certainty. Convex topography such as ridges,
              spurs, and peaks is often subject to faster and deeper thaw than
              other areas. Permafrost degradation in steep bedrock can be
              strongly affected by percolating water in fractures. This
              degradation by advection is difficult to predict and can lead to
              quick and deep development of thaw corridors along fractures in
              permafrost and potentially destabilize much greater volumes of
              rock than conduction would. Although most research on steep

  abstract = "Mountain regions are highly sensitive to global climate change.
              However, large scale assessments of mountain environments remain
              problematic due to the high resolution required of model grids to
              capture strong lateral variability. To alleviate this, tools are
              required to bridge the scale gap between gridded climate datasets
              (climate models and re-analyses) and mountain topography. We
              address this problem with a sub-grid method. It relies on
              sampling the most important aspects of land surface heterogeneity
              through a lumped scheme, allowing for the application of
              numerical land surface models (LSMs) over large areas in mountain
              regions or other heterogeneous environments. This is achieved by
              including the effect of mountain topography on these processes at
              the sub-grid scale using a multidimensional informed sampling
              procedure together with a 1-D lumped model that can be driven by
              gridded climate datasets. This paper provides a description of
              this sub-grid scheme, TopoSUB, and assesses its performance
              against a distributed model. We demonstrate the ability of
              TopoSUB to approximate results simulated by a distributed
              numerical LSM at around 104 less computations. These significant
              gains in computing resources allow for: (1) numerical modelling

              Landsat-5 record for the Kern River watershed in the Sierra
              Nevada, California. The data assimilation approach explicitly
              treats sources of uncertainty from model parameters,
              meteorological inputs, and observations. The method is comprised
              of two main components: (1) a coupled land surface model (LSM)
              and snow depletion curve (SDC) model, which is used to generate
              an ensemble of predictions of SWE and fractional snow cover area
              (FSCA) for a given set of prior (uncertain) inputs, and (2) a
              retrospective reanalysis step, which updates estimation variables
              to be consistent with the observed fractional snow cover time
              series. The final posterior SWE estimate is generated from the
              LSM-SDC using the posterior estimation variables consistently
              with all postulated sources of uncertainty in the model, inputs,
              and observations. A reasonable agreement was found between the
              SWE reanalysis and in situ SWE observations and streamflow data.
              The data set was studied to evaluate factors controlling SWE
              spatial and temporal variability. Elevation was found to be the
              primary control on spatial patterns of peak-SWE and day-of-peak.
              The easting coordinate had additional explanatory power, which is
              hypothesized to be related to rain shadow effects due to the
              prevailing storm track directions. The spatial patterns were
              found to be interannually inconsistent. However, drier years and
              lower elevations were found more variable than wetter years and
              higher elevations, respectively. Only a very small percentage of
              the Kern River watershed had a significant trend in peak-SWE and
              day-of-peak. Trends deemed to be significant were found to be
              positive (peak-SWE is increasing and day-of-peak occurs later) at
              higher elevations, but negative (peak-SWE is decreasing and
              day-of-peak occurs earlier) at lower elevations. The reanalysis
              approach proved to be useful in terms of identifying subwatershed

               procedure related to the link frequency distribution of the

               estimating model parameters and state variables using particle

               Methods for batch calibration, despite major recent advances,
               appear to lack the flexibility required to treat uncertainties

              streamflows. We use a conceptual semi-distributed model based on
              elevation bands [Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP)],
              frequently used for water management, and a physically oriented,
              fully distributed model [Topographic Kinematic Wave Approximation
              and Integration ETH Zurich (TOPKAPI-ETH)] developed for research
              purposes mainly. We evaluate the ability of the two models to
              reproduce the key hydrological processes in the basin with
              emphasis on snow accumulation and melt, streamflow and the
              relationships between internal processes. Both models are capable
              of reproducing observed runoff and the evolution of
              Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer snow cover
              adequately. In spite of WEAP's simple and conceptual approach for
              modelling snowmelt and its lack of glacier representation and
              snow gravitational redistribution as well as a proper routing
              algorithm, this model can reproduce historical data with a
              similar goodness of fit as the more complex TOPKAPI-ETH. We show
              that the performance of both models can be improved by using
              measured precipitation gradients of higher temporal resolution.
              In contrast to the good performance of the conceptual model for
              the present climate, however, we demonstrate that the
              simplifications in WEAP lead to error compensation, which results
              in different predictions in simulated melt and runoff for a
              potentially warmer future climate. TOPKAPI-ETH, using a more
              physical representation of processes, depends less on calibration
              and thus is less subject to a compensation of errors through
              different model components. Our results show that data obtained
              locally in ad hoc short-term field campaigns are needed to
              complement data extrapolated from long-term records for
              simulating changes in the water cycle of high-elevation

               concerned with flood or drought forecasting, reservoir operation
               and inland waterway management. In this study, we address the
               question of how sensitive hydrological models are to the
               representation of snow cover dynamics and whether the
               performance of a hydrological model can be enhanced by
               integrating data from a dedicated external snow monitoring
               system. As a framework for our tests we have used the
               hydrological model HBV (Hydrologiska Byr{\aa}ns
               Vattenbalansavdelning) in the version HBV-light, which has been
               applied in many hydrological studies and is also in use for
               operational purposes. While HBV originally follows a
               temperature-index approach with time-invariant calibrated
               degree-day factors to represent snowmelt, in this study the HBV
               model was modified to use snowmelt time series from an external

               with assimilation of observational snow data from a dense
               monitoring network, (b) the same snow model but with data
               assimilation switched off and (c) a downgraded version of the
               same snow model representing snowmelt with a time-invariant
               degree-day factor. Model runs were conducted for 20 catchments
               at different elevations within Switzerland for 15 years. Our
               results show that at low and mid-elevations the performance of
               the runoff simulations did not vary considerably with the snow
               model version chosen. At higher elevations, however, best
               performance in terms of simulated runoff was obtained when using
               the snowmelt time series from the snow model, which utilized
               data assimilation. This was especially true for snow-rich years.
               These findings suggest that with increasing elevation and the
               correspondingly increased contribution of snowmelt to runoff,
               the accurate estimation of snow water equivalent (SWE) and
               snowmelt rates has gained importance.",

               characteristics (SRCs) prior to using remote sensing information
               has become important. A point spread function (PSF) is typically
               used to describe the SRCs of the observation cells from remote
               sensors and is always estimated in a laboratory before the
               sensor is launched. However, research on the SRCs of high-order

               multi-scale remote sensing products and validating
               coarse-resolution products. This study proposed a method that
               combines simulation and validation to establish SRC models of

               that provide the required sub-pixel information. The analysis
               proves that the size of the surface support of each albedo pixel
               is larger than the nominal resolution of the pixel and that the
               response weight is non-uniformly distributed, with an elliptical

              (SWE) in mountainous terrain is currently the most important
              unsolved problem in snow hydrology. Several methods can estimate
              the amount of snow throughout a mountain range: (1) Spatial
              interpolation from surface sensors constrained by remotely sensed
              snow extent provides a consistent answer, with uncertainty
              related to extrapolation to unrepresented locations. (2) The
              remotely sensed date of disappearance of snow is combined with a
              melt calculation to reconstruct the SWE back to the last
              significant snowfall. (3) Passive microwave sensors offer
              real-time global SWE estimates but suffer from several problems
              like subpixel variability in the mountains. (4) A numerical model
              combined with assimilated surface observations produces SWE at
              1-km resolution at continental scales, but depends heavily on a
              surface network. (5) New methods continue to be explored, for
              example, airborne LiDAR altimetry provides direct measurements of
              snow depth, which are combined with modelled snow density to
              estimate SWE. While the problem is aggressively addressed, the

  abstract = "Accurate knowledge on snow distribution in alpine terrain is
              crucial for various applications such as flood risk assessment,
              avalanche warning or managing water supply and hydro-power. To
              simulate the seasonal snow cover development in alpine terrain,
              the spatially distributed, physics-based model Alpine3D is
              suitable. The model is typically driven by spatial interpolations
              of observations from automatic weather stations (AWS), leading to
              errors in the spatial distribution of atmospheric forcing. With
              recent advances in remote sensing techniques, maps of snow depth
              can be acquired with high spatial resolution and accuracy. In
              this work, maps of the snow depth distribution, calculated from
              summer and winter digital surface models based on Airborne
              Digital Sensors (ADS), are used to scale precipitation input
              data, with the aim to improve the accuracy of simulation of the
              spatial distribution of snow with Alpine3D. A simple method to
              scale and redistribute precipitation is presented and the
              performance is analysed. The scaling method is only applied if it
              is snowing. For rainfall the precipitation is distributed by
              interpolation, with a simple air temperature threshold used for
              the determination of the precipitation phase. It was found that
              the accuracy of spatial snow distribution could be improved
              significantly for the simulated domain. The standard deviation of
              absolute snow depth error is reduced up to a factor 3.4 to less
              than 20 cm. The mean absolute error in snow distribution was
              reduced when using representative input sources for the
              simulation domain. For inter-annual scaling, the model
              performance could also be improved, even when using a remote
              sensing dataset from a different winter. In conclusion, using
              remote sensing data to process precipitation input, complex
              processes such as preferential snow deposition and snow
              relocation due to wind or avalanches, can be substituted and
              modelling performance of spatial snow distribution is improved.",

  author   = "Girotto, Manuela and Margulis, Steven A and Durand, Michael",
  abstract = "Snow accumulation and melt is highly variable in space and time
              in complex mountainous environments. Therefore, it is necessary
              to provide high-resolution spatially and temporally distributed
              estimates of sub-basin snow water equivalent (SWE) to accurately
              predict the timing and magnitude of snowmelt runoff. In this
              study, we compare two reconstruction techniques (a commonly used
              deterministic reconstruction vs a probabilistic data assimilation
              framework). The methods retrospectively estimate SWE from a time
              series of remotely sensed maps of fractional snow-covered area
              (FSCA). In testing both methods over the Tokopah watershed in the
              Sierra Nevada (California), the probabilistic reconstruction
              approach is shown to be a more robust generalization of the
              deterministic reconstruction. Under idealized conditions, both
              probabilistic and deterministic approaches perform reasonably
              well and yield similar results when compared with in situ
              verification data, whereas the probabilistic reconstruction was
              found to be in slightly better agreement with snow-pit
              observations. More importantly, the probabilistic approach was
              found to be more robust: unaccounted for biases in solar
              radiation impacted the probabilistic SWE estimates less than the
              deterministic case (4\% vs 7\% errors for water year (WY)1997 and
              0\% vs 3\% errors for WY1999); the probabilistic reconstruction
              was found to be less sensitive to the number of available
              observations (6\% vs 10\% errors in WY1997 and 13\% vs 44\%
              errors in WY1999 from the nominal cases when four fewer FSCA
              images were available). Finally, results from the probabilistic
              reconstruction approach, which requires precipitation inputs
              (unlike the deterministic approach), were found to be relatively
              robust to bias in prior precipitation estimates, where the
              nominal case mean estimates were recovered even when an
              underestimated prior precipitation was used. The additional
              robustness of the probabilistic SWE reconstruction technique
              should prove useful in future applications over larger basins and
              longer periods in mountainous terrain. Copyright \copyright{}

               crucial for numerous applications in snow and avalanche research
               as well as in hydrology and ecology. Today, snow depth
               distributions are usually estimated using point measurements
               performed by automated weather stations and observers in the
               field combined with interpolation algorithms. However, these
               methodologies are not able to capture the high spatial
               variability of the snow depth distribution present in alpine
               terrain. Continuous and accurate snow depth mapping has been
               successfully performed using laser scanning but this method can
               only cover limited areas and is expensive. We use the airborne
               ADS80 optoelectronic scanner, acquiring stereo imagery with 0.25
               m spatial resolution to derive digital surface models (DSMs) of
               winter and summer terrains in the neighborhood of Davos,
               Switzerland. The DSMs are generated using photogrammetric image
               correlation techniques based on the multispectral nadir and
               backward-looking sensor data. In order to assess the accuracy of
               the photogrammetric products, we compare these products with the

               accuracy of $\pm$30 cm (root mean square error) in the complex

               short- and long-term effects of geomorphic variation on the
               partitioning of the lateral surface and subsurface water and
               surface energy fluxes. The topography of the Little Washita
               basin (Oklahoma) and of the Serraia basin (Trentino, Italy) have
               been used as base topographies from which virtual topographies
               with altered slopes and elevations have been created with
               corresponding modifications of the soil thickness and the
               extension of the channel network, according to applicable
               geomorphological theories, in order to quantify the contribution
               of these topographic features to the spatial and temporal
               variability of energy and water fluxes. Simulation results show
               that both a more extended channel network and more accentuated
               slopes cause an increase in the discharge balanced by a
               diminution of the evapotranspiration. The diminution of the
               latent heat flux is balanced by the increase in the sensible
               heat flux. Net radiation shows a minor sensitivity to
               topography. Evaporative fraction, on the contrary, is shown to
               be strongly dependent on geomorphic characteristics. The results

              deep snow and at 4 lower-elevation Cooperative Observer Program

              retrievals are typically biased low and assimilation without

              assimilation could not improve the interannual SWE variations in
              the assimilation results because the AMSR-E retrievals lack
              realistic interannual variability in deep snowpacks. SCF
              assimilation has only a marginal impact at the SNOTEL locations
              because these sites experience extended periods of near-complete
              snow cover. Across all sites, SCF assimilation improves the

              water resource for crop irrigation in the semiarid regions of
              Morocco. Recent studies have used assimilation of snow cover area
              data from high-resolution optical sensors to compute the snow
              water equivalent and snow melt in other mountain regions. These
              techniques however require large model ensembles, and therefore
              it is a challenge to determine the adequate model resolution that
              yields accurate results with reasonable computation time. Here we
              study the sensitivity of an energy balance model to the
              resolution of the model grid for a pilot catchment in the High
              Atlas. We used a time series of 8-m resolution snow cover area
              maps with an average revisit time of 7.5 days to evaluate the
              model results. The digital elevation model was generated from
              Pl{\'e}iades stereo images and resampled from 8 to 30, 90, 250,
              500, and 1,000 m. The results indicate that the model performs
              well from 8 to 250 m but the agreement with observations drops at
              500 m. This is because significant features of the topography
              were too smoothed out to properly characterize the spatial
              variability of meteorological forcing, including solar radiation.
              We conclude that a resolution of 250 m might be sufficient in
              this area. This result is consistent with the shape of the
              semivariogram of the topographic slope, suggesting that this
              semivariogram analysis could be used to transpose our conclusion

  abstract = "Direct snow depth measurements are sparse, especially in remote
              areas. In this study, we assess the potential of ICESat laser
              altimetry for providing snow depths for its operational period
              2003--2009 on the example of the Scandinavian Mountains in
              southern Norway. Snow cover during ICESat campaigns typically
              results in positive elevation differences (dh) between ICESat
              GLAH14 elevations and reference elevations from Digital Elevation
              Models (DEMs). Three DEMs are used: the Norwegian national DEM
              for the entire study area, and the SRTM DEM and a high-resolution
              airborne lidar DEM for a spatial subset on the Hardangervidda
              mountain plateau. To account for uncertainty in elevation data,
              ICESat samples are grouped into spatial subsets, elevation bands,
              and over time (e.g. all winter campaigns together). We find that
              ICESat has the potential to provide regional-scale snow depths
              for the years 2003--2009 for its winter (March) and late spring
              (June) campaigns. ICESat-derived snow depth time series for
              different elevation bands agree well with measured (RMSE 0.47m)
              and modelled (RMSE 0.61m) snow depths in the study area. Annual
              differences in snow amounts and the increase of snow depths with
              elevation and coastal proximity over the study area are correctly
              reproduced. Uncertainties in reference elevations exceed ICESat
              elevation uncertainty and good control over errors and biases in
              reference DEMs turn out essential. Spatially varying vertical
              offsets between ICESat and the reference DEMs make it necessary
              to bias-correct March/June snow depths with autumn dh per spatial
              unit or elevation band. Best results are achieved when samples
              are summarised per season over the entire observation period.
              After correction of local DEM biases, the spatial pattern of
              ICESat 2003--2009 March dh matches spatially distributed modelled
              snow depths in southern Norway with decimeter-scale accuracy. In
              the western part of Hardangervidda, ICESat-based March snow
              depths agree better with measurements (RMSE $\leq$0.15m for all
              DEMs) than modelled snow depths do (RMSE 0.61m). In eastern
              Hardangervidda, the coarse resolution SRTM DEM (RMSE 0.41m)
              performs better than the 10m Norwegian DEM (RMSE 0.64m) which is
              based on a less consistent mosaic of elevation data. Using the
              high-resolution lidar DEM, even single footprints show good
              agreement (R2 0.59, RMSE 0.94m) with measured snow depths from
              the same year. Snow depth estimates could be further improved by
              using full waveform ICESat data or elevation measurements from
              ICESat-2 once this satellite is operational. Good quality
              reference DEMs may still be acquired in the future even in areas
              where no such data exists today.",
